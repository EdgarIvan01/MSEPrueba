# Model Improvement Project

## Description

This project was undertaken with the goal of improving the accuracy of a machine learning model by reducing the mean square error (MSE) by 10%. Throughout development, several techniques were implemented and tested to tune and optimize the model.

## Objective

The main goal was to decrease the MSE by 10% compared to the initial version of the model.

## Results

After making the necessary adjustments and optimizing the hyperparameters, we managed to reduce the MSE by **10%** compared to the original model. This represents a significant improvement in the accuracy of the model.
